Course Description
==================

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary and emerging field, which develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. Being a Bioinformatician requires an integrated skill set, including computer science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering. This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing topic and equip them with some of its fundamental principles, related algorithms, and programming skill as well as useful tools.
